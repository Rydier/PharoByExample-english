\chapter{The Opal Compiler} \chalabel{opal}

%\alex{I addressed lukas comments using editorial macros. Please, if you read this, remove this comment and remove the editorial macros, else their purpose is diminished}

\jr{I think that the first thing that we need is a description of the Opal model, with the different classes that take part in it. Then we can explain how the compilation and decompilation work. And also explain the intermediate representation. Finally, how to extend and change the compilation process.}

\indexmain{opal}
\opal is a Smalltalk to Bytecode compiler for Pharo. This project was initiated to replace the original compiler, which slowly evolved from the one developed in the 80s. \ugh{It was designed in one process Scanner/Parser}. The result is \ins{that} the old compiler is hard to understand, to extend, and \ugh{completely unadapted to the new needs}. \chg{That's why the \opal project started}{This is why a new flexible, configurable and adaptable compiler was needed, \opal fulfill this need.}. 

\ugh{The \opal process} \jr{I do not understand the \opal process expression, what does it mean? the compilation process?}, is built around 3 steps, covering all the steps \jr{the steps of what?} from source code to the bytecode.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Source code to abstract syntax tree,
\item Abstract syntax tree to intermediary representation,
\item Intermediary representation to bytecode.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fullProcess}
	\caption{\opal complete compilation process. \figlabel{fullProcess}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Loading Opal}

\ugh{\opal will be the default compiler for Pharo} \jr{Weak and irrelevant, it is a compiler, that is good enough}. Right now we should load it to be able to execute the code snippets used in this chapter.

\begin{code}{}
	Gofer new
		squeaksource: 'OpalCompiler';
		package: 'ConfigurationOfOpalCompiler';
		load.
		
	(Smalltalk at: #ConfigurationOfOpalCompiler) load.
\end{code}


\section{Abstract Syntax Tree process}

\jr{I do not get the title "process", what does it mean?, what is the AST process?}

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{SourceToAnnotatedAST}
	\caption{Source to AST Annotated \figlabel{SourceToAnnotatedAST} \jr{what is RBParser and OCASTSemanticAnalyzer? we never explained that}}
\end{figure}

The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the source code. The AST is easy to manipulate and to \ugh{visit} \jr{Should we assume that the reader knows what the visitor pattern is? at least we should have a reference.}. The AST used by \opal comes from Refactoring Engine \jr{Include reference to the Refactoring Engine chapter.}. It uses \ct{RBParser} to generate ASTs, this step verifies the syntax.

The structure of an AST is a simple tree. Evaluate and explore the following expression:

\begin{code}{}
t := RBParser parseExpression: '1 + 2'.
"explore it"

\end{code}


\sd{so what do we see? we should add t something }

Using the message \ct{parseExpression:} we get an AST representing the expression.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{SimpleAtomicExpression}
	\caption{Generated tree for  '1 + 2'  \figlabel{SimpleAtomicExpression} \jr{the font of the image is too small it should be similar to the text font, besides we have space for enlarging the image.}}
\end{figure}

Let's try another example
\begin{code}{}
RBParser parseExpression: 'one plus: two'.
"inspect it"
\end{code}


\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{SimpleAtomicExpressionP}
	\caption{Generated tree for  'one plus: two' \figlabel{SimpleAtomicExpressionP} \jr{the font of the image is too small it should be similar to the text font, besides we have space for enlarging the image.}}
\end{figure}



\begin{code}{}
RBParser parseExpression: 'one plus: two plus: three'.
"inspect it"
\end{code}
\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{SimpleMultiExpression}
	\caption{Generated tree for  'one plus: two plus: three' \figlabel{SimpleMultiExpression}}
\end{figure}

You can also \ugh{compile} \jr{we should be careful here, we say that we can compile but we call parse, so maybe we should explain what is going on when we call this method.} a method using the message \ct{parseMethod:} instead of \ct{parseExpression:}. We will get a methodNode object:

\begin{code}{}
RBParser parseMethod: 'xPlusY x + y'.
"inspect it"
\end{code}


\sd{so what do we see? we should add t something }

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ASTbeforeSemanticAnalysis}
	\caption{Generated tree for  'xPlusY x + y' \figlabel{ASTbeforeSemanticAnalysis}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{\chg{Annotated}{Annotating} the Abstract Syntax Tree}

Once parsed we can perform a semantic analysis of the AST. The goal of a semantic analysis is to add semantic data to the generated tree. One of the key function of the semantic analysis is to bind variables. 
Because as we \chg{see}{saw} before the AST only checks the \emph{syntax} of the code. A semantic analysis  checks the semantics of the code: for example, \ugh{if in context of a specific class}, the code is valid. We can identify if a variable is undeclared or used out of scope, or if a message is send to the UI. 

The AST is annotated by visiting the graph by two visitors:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ct{OCASTSemanticAnalyzer} performs the variable binding.
\item \ct{OCASTClosureAnalyzer} performs the closure analysis \jr{What is the closure analysis?}.
\end{itemize}

Let's try an example:

\begin{code}{}
|ast|
ast := RBParser parseExpression: '1 + 2'.

"visit and annotated the AST for the closure analysis "
OCASTClosureAnalyzer new visitNode: ast.
"visit and annotated the AST for the var binding"

OCASTSemanticAnalyzer new
		scope: Object parseScope;
		visitNode: ast.
ast. "inspect It"
\end{code}
\jr{Maybe we need to break this into pieces and explain each of them, or enumerate the lines.}


\sd{what do we get?}

All the data of binding is injected in the AST, when you inspect your AST you can see the value properties is now 
set to a dictionary. \sd{show it}





\section{Intermediary Representation}

\jr{Do we want to call this section Intermediary or Intermediate?}

Once we obtain an AST annotated with semantic data, we can translate it into an intermediary representation (IR). \ugh{The intermediary representation is a abstraction over bytecode structured in tree. The advantages of IR over bytecode is that it is higher-level} \jr{we need a better definition}. In addition\ins{,} with IR we can \ugh{plug} different bytecode sets in the compilation process \jr{why? why is that relevant here?}. We could think about generating bytecode from a Smalltalk subset to LegoOS \jr{What the LegoOS, reference?}. In addition IR is easier to manipulate  than bytecode itself \jr{really? why? we need to demonstrate that here}.
 Usually the bytecode optimization will be realized after this step \jr{Now we are talking about optimizations why?}.
 
\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{AnnotatedASTToIR}
	\caption{AST Annotated to Intermediary Representation \figlabel{AnnotatedASTToIR} \jr{The captions should be a sentence that adds some information otherwise they are meaningless}}
\end{figure}



\ugh{Once we have an AST, it is easy to transform an AST to an Intermediary Representation Tree} \jr{I do not understand this sentence}. The class \ct{IRBuilder} \jr{Who is this? API? what does it model?} offers all the infrastructure to add each possible node. A \chg{Visitor}{visitor} walks an AST and builds its corresponding IR tree. \ct{ASTTranslator}  visits each node and for each node  builds the corresponding IR node sequence. \jr{How is the IRBuilder, ASTTRanslator, etc related? maybe a picture here would help. }

\sd{we need a code snippet}

\section{Bytecode}
Once we have an IR tree, we will transform the IR tree in a bytecode sequence. We apply a new visitor but on the IR tree this time. Since IR is close to bytecode, the visitors visits each node and pushes the corresponding bytecode.

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{IRToBytecode}
